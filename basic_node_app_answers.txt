1. What is a Node module?

A group of functions used in your application, paired down to small pieces that can be added to do specific tasks.

2. What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?

module.exports is a variable that gets returned with require(). It is empty by default.

exports is a reference to module.exports

3. Why is using exports recommended?

It references the module.exports object. However, if you reassign exports to something else, it will no longer reference module.exports and will not work.
